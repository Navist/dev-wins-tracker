## **🚀 Dev Wins Tracker: Structured Learning & Work System**

### **1️⃣ Pre-Work Ritual (5-10 mins)**
🔹 **Purpose:** Shift your brain into "work mode" automatically.  
🔹 **Steps:**
1. **Make a drink** (coffee, tea, or water) ☕  
2. **Put on focus music** 🎵 (lofi, instrumental, or white noise)  
3. **Review yesterday’s progress** (skim your last Dev Wins Log or notes)  
4. **Set today’s goal** (Pick **one** small goal for the session)  

✅ **Example:**  
📌 **Yesterday’s Progress:** Finished implementing bcrypt password hashing.  
🎯 **Today’s Goal:** Set up `OAuthAccounts` table and insert test data.  

👉 **Why it Works:** Your brain learns to associate this ritual with deep work over time.

### **2️⃣ Start with a Warm-Up Task (5 mins)**
🔹 **Purpose:** Ease into the work instead of forcing focus.  
🔹 **Options:**
- **Re-type a small piece of code from memory** (e.g., a function you wrote yesterday).  
- **Read one short section of documentation** for a tool you’re using (e.g., FastAPI, SQLAlchemy).  
- **Write a 2-sentence summary** of what you’re about to do.  

👉 **Why it Works:** Warm-ups reduce friction and get you thinking about code before diving into complex work.

### **3️⃣ Deep Work Session (45-90 mins)**
🔹 **Purpose:** Focused coding session with a clear goal.  
🔹 **Steps:**
1. **Work on the task you set earlier.**  
2. **Type code manually, don’t just copy-paste.**  
3. **Write comments as you go to explain tricky parts.**  
4. **If stuck, write down the problem before Googling.**  

✅ **Example:**  
🎯 **Goal:** Implement database model for `OAuthAccounts`  
🔄 **Steps:**  
- Define SQLAlchemy model  
- Write migration script with Alembic  
- Insert test data  

---

### **4️⃣ Mid-Session Check-In (Quick Reflection)**
🔹 **Purpose:** Prevent frustration and adjust if needed.  
🔹 **Ask Yourself:**
- **Am I making progress?**  
- **If stuck, what is blocking me?**  
- **Should I adjust my approach?**  

👉 **If stuck for more than 10-15 mins, break it down into a smaller problem or look at an example.**

---

### **5️⃣ End-of-Session Recap (10 mins)**
🔹 **Purpose:** Solidify what you learned & prepare for next time.  
🔹 **Steps:**
1. **Write a Dev Wins Log entry** 📒  
2. **Summarize what you learned or fixed**  
3. **Set up tomorrow’s goal**  

✅ **Example Entry:**  
📅 **Date:** Feb 24, 2025  
🎯 **Goal Completed:** Created `OAuthAccounts` table & tested insertion.  
🐛 **Bug Fixed:** `"column does not exist"` error (forgot to run migration).  
📌 **Lesson Learned:** Always run `alembic upgrade head` after schema changes.  
🎯 **Tomorrow’s Goal:** Implement OAuth login flow with FastAPI.  

---

### **6️⃣ If Focus is Fading → Use Quick Fixes**
🔹 **Feeling distracted?** Try:
- **5-minute break** → Walk around, stretch.  
- **Change workspace** → Move to another desk or adjust lighting.  
- **Use the "5-Minute Rule"** → Tell yourself, “I’ll just do 5 more minutes.”  

🔹 **Feeling drained?**  
- **Switch to passive learning** (watch a coding video or read docs).  
- **Stop and rest** → Forcing it won’t be productive.  

---

## **🔥 Why This System Works**
✅ **You don’t rely on motivation** → A **routine** makes focus automatic.  
✅ **Breaks tasks into small, achievable steps** → No overwhelm.  
✅ **Reflecting at the end improves retention** → Logging wins boosts confidence.  
✅ **Adapts to energy levels** → If tired, shift to passive learning.
