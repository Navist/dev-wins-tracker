### **📚 Review of Concepts Reinforced Today**  

## **🛠️ CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**  
✅ **Reinforced your understanding of CRUD in FastAPI**  
- Implementing **`POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`** for different resources (`/wins/` and `/categories/`).  
- Ensuring **users can only modify their own records** (authorization).  
- Handling **category dependencies** (users cannot delete a category in use).  

🔹 **Key Takeaways:**  
- FastAPI handles HTTP methods easily with `@app.post()`, `@app.get()`, etc.  
- Using **Pydantic models** to structure request/response data.  
- Implementing **DB constraints** to enforce logical relationships.  
- Preventing unwanted modifications with **user-based filtering** (`WHERE user_id = current_user`).  

---

## **🔐 Authentication & Authorization (JWT & Role-Based Access)**  
✅ **Reinforced token-based authentication with JWT**  
- **Checked for valid tokens** in protected routes.  
- **Ensured users could only modify their own data** (e.g., only deleting their own wins).  

✅ **Started implementing role-based access control (RBAC)**  
- Making sure **admins** can view/edit all data but users can only see their own.  

🔹 **Key Takeaways:**  
- JWT authentication provides a **secure way to verify users**.  
- **Bearer tokens** are included in requests (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).  
- Role-based restrictions can be implemented via **database checks** (`is_admin` column or role system).  

---

## **📦 Database Relationships & Constraints**  
✅ **Worked with foreign keys & constraints**  
- Ensured users **cannot delete a category** if wins reference it.  
- Enforced **user ownership** (a user can only update/delete their own wins).  

🔹 **Key Takeaways:**  
- **Foreign keys** help maintain **data integrity** (e.g., `wins.category_id → categories.id`).  
- **ON DELETE RESTRICT** prevents deleting dependent data.  
- Adding constraints at the **database level** reduces the need for excessive manual validation in code.  

---

## **🛠️ API Testing with Postman**  
✅ **Practiced testing endpoints with Postman**  
- Setting **headers (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`)** for protected endpoints.  
- Sending **JSON requests** for POST/PUT.  
- Checking **error handling and responses** for validation and permissions.  

🔹 **Key Takeaways:**  
- **Postman is essential** for debugging API endpoints before writing automated tests.  
- **Well-structured API responses** make debugging easier (`{"message": "...", "data": {...}}`).  
- Testing **edge cases** (invalid tokens, unauthorized access, missing fields) helps prevent security holes.  

---

## **🔮 Preparing for OAuth (Google & GitHub Login)**  
✅ **Researched how OAuth will be integrated**  
- How to **handle linking OAuth accounts** to existing users.  
- What scopes are needed for **Google/GitHub authentication**.  

🔹 **Key Takeaways:**  
- OAuth2 is **not just for login**; users might want to **link** accounts later.  
- OAuth requires **client credentials, redirects, and token exchange**.  

---

### **🚀 Summary**  
✔ **Reinforced** CRUD operations with real-world constraints.  
✔ **Strengthened** authentication & role-based access concepts.  
✔ **Improved** API testing skills with Postman.  
✔ **Gained insight** into OAuth workflows.  

You’re **making excellent progress** on your backend skills! The **next step** is **polishing CRUD** and **starting OAuth** implementation.  

### **📝 Review of Your Code Updates & Progress**  

You’ve made great progress today, especially in refining **CRUD operations for Wins, Categories, and User Authentication**. Below is a summary of the key updates and some suggestions for improvement.

---

## **🚀 Key Updates & Improvements**
### **1️⃣ Wins (`wins.py`)**
✅ **Implemented `create_win`**  
- Ensures that the category exists before adding a new win.  
- Checks both predefined and custom categories for validity.  

✅ **Implemented `read_wins` and `read_win`**  
- Users can **only see their own wins** (proper filtering).  
- Added a **filtered search** by category (`ilike` for case-insensitive search).  

✅ **Implemented `delete_win`**  
- Users can **only delete their own wins**.  
- Returns structured **JSON response** on deletion.  

⚠ **Missing Feature:**  
❌ **`update_win` is not implemented yet** (currently just `pass`).  
- You’ll need to allow users to update their own **title, description, or category**.

---

### **2️⃣ Categories (`categories.py`)**
✅ **Implemented `create_custom_category` and `create_predefined_category`**  
- **Custom categories:** Users can only create **a limited number** based on their subscription.  
- **Predefined categories:** Can only be created by **admins**.  

✅ **Implemented `delete_custom_category` and `delete_predefined_category`**  
- Ensures **only the user or admin can delete categories**.  
- Predefined categories are restricted to **admin-only deletion**.  

✅ **Implemented `read_custom_categories` and `read_predefined_categories`**  
- Users can view **only their own** custom categories.  
- Admins can see **all predefined categories**.  

🔹 **Great additions:**  
- **Subscription-based category limits** using `sub_tiers.get()`.  
- **Clear validation messages** for when users exceed their category limit.  

---

### **3️⃣ Users (`users.py`)**
✅ **Added `create_user` endpoint**  
- Ensures **hashed passwords** are stored securely.  

✅ **Improved `login` functionality**  
- Checks if the **JWT token is still valid** before generating a new one.  
- **Refresh tokens** are properly handled.  

✅ **Added `logout` function**  
- Revokes access and refresh tokens.  

✅ **Added `update_password` functionality**  
- Validates **old password before updating**.  

✅ **Added `promote_user` function**  
- Allows **admin-only role promotion**.  

🔹 **Strong security improvements:**  
- Prevents **unauthorized account changes**.  
- Uses **JWT expiration checking** to avoid unnecessary logins.  

---

### **4️⃣ Database Models (`models.py`)**
✅ **Added structured relationships for all tables**  
- **Users & OAuth:** Tracks linked OAuth accounts.  
- **Users & Wins:** Users can **only access their own wins**.  
- **Users & Categories:** Users can have **both custom and predefined categories**.  
- **Subscriptions:** Tracks users’ **premium/free** status.  

🔹 **Great design choices:**  
- `ondelete="CASCADE"` ensures **data is removed properly** when a user is deleted.  
- **Foreign key constraints** prevent orphaned records.  

⚠ **Potential improvement:**  
- Consider adding `updated_at = Column(DateTime, default=func.now(), onupdate=func.now())` to track updates.  

---

## **🛠️ Next Steps for Tomorrow**
### **🔹 Finalize CRUD Operations**
- [ ] Implement `update_win` so users can **edit their existing wins**.  
- [ ] Ensure users **cannot update wins they don’t own**.  

### **🔹 Subscription System**
- [ ] Implement `/subscribers/` CRUD to manage **premium users**.  
- [ ] Ensure **only admins can modify subscriptions**.  

### **🔹 API Documentation & Testing**
- [ ] Add Swagger (`/docs`).  
- [ ] Write unit tests for **authentication & CRUD**.  
- [ ] Validate Postman API responses.
