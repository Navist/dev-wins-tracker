### **1️⃣ Set SMART Goals for Each Day**
Your goals should be:  
✅ **S**pecific – Clearly define the task (e.g., "Implement user authentication in FastAPI")  
✅ **M**easurable – Have a way to check completion (e.g., "Test login with a sample user")  
✅ **A**chievable – Be realistic with your time/energy for the day  
✅ **R**elevant – Directly impact your project’s progress  
✅ **T**ime-bound – Aim to complete it **within the day**

🚀 **Example:**  
💡 Instead of: "Work on user authentication"  
✅ Goal: "Set up password hashing with bcrypt and store user credentials in PostgreSQL."

### **2️⃣ Break Down Large Tasks Into Micro-Steps**
If a goal is too big, break it down into **bite-sized chunks** to avoid feeling overwhelmed.

🔹 **Example:** Setting up OAuth authentication  
Instead of: "Implement Google and GitHub login"  
✅ **Day 1:** Set up OAuth model & database structure  
✅ **Day 2:** Implement Google OAuth login flow  
✅ **Day 3:** Implement GitHub OAuth login flow  
✅ **Day 4:** Test & refine authentication system

This keeps progress **steady** and **manageable**.

### **3️⃣ Use the 80/20 Rule to Prioritize**
- **Identify the 20% of tasks** that will **push 80% of progress forward**.  
- Example: Instead of worrying about UI early on, **prioritize core backend logic first**.  

🔹 **Example of prioritization:**  
✅ **Priority:** Making sure users can log in (critical feature)  
🚫 **Lower Priority:** Styling the login form (can be done later)

### **4️⃣ Track Progress & Keep a Dev Wins Log**
Since you’re making a **small development wins tracker**, use **your own system** to track progress!  
- Each time you complete a goal, log it as a **small win** to **reinforce motivation.**  
- Also, document **any errors you fixed** so you won’t waste time debugging the same issue later.

🚀 **Example Dev Wins Log Entry:**  
📅 **Date:** Feb 24, 2025  
✅ **Goal Completed:** Implemented password hashing with bcrypt  
🐛 **Bug Fixed:** `"TypeError: can't concat str and bytes"` (Forgot to decode before storing)  
📌 **Lesson Learned:** Always decode hashed passwords before saving in the database.

### **5️⃣ Plan Tomorrow’s Goal at the End of Each Day**
- Take **5 minutes at the end of each day** to write **tomorrow’s task**.  
- This avoids wasting time deciding **where to start** in the morning.
